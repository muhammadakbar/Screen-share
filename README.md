Screen-share
============

Web Based Screen Sharing Software :)


    Share full screen with one or more users in HD format!
    Make sure you enabled the flag "Enable screen capture support in getUserMedia" via "chrome://flags".

    Screen-sharing fails if you've not enabled that flag.
    Recursive cascade images or blurred screen experiences occur only when you try to share screen between two tabs on the same system. This NEVER happens when sharing between unique systems or devices.
    Firefox has no support of screen-sharing yet.
    Remember, it is not desktop sharing!
